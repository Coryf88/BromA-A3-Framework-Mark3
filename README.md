The **BromA Framework** is a community effort made by the BromA group in order to establish a standard shared across all missions - which could then be customized by the content maker.

Since this could only be made thanks to shared scripts, missions and all sorts of knowledge, this project is entirely open-source and interested users are free to play with it as much as they want.

Also keeping up with good practices, most functionality is modular and therefore optional to the user: adding and disabling plugins from the mission is extremely easy.

### FEATURES
*	Well organized and context-agnostic.
*	Plugin system makes sharing functionality super easy.
*	Tasks system which is very flexible and simple to understand.
*	AGM, TFAR and DAC are fully integrated.
*	Team killing warning.
*	Teleporting for the mission maker.
*	Simple loading screen to avoid desync at mission start.
*	Limit player movement to the AO.
*	Team Roster.
*	Respawn system with tickets and respawn waves.
*	Casualty Cap and Body Removal, taken from the F3 Framework with given credits.
*	Commander Lock which makes weapons cold.
*	Mission time limit.
*	Setup Zone for TvTs.
*	Spawn protection.
*	Casualty cap for civilians.
*	JIPs can teleport to their squadmates when joining.
*	Very effective loadout system.
*	Cargo made simple.

The framework is as context agnostic as possible, meaning you can just change one value and your mission will change from a COOP into a TVT or even a COTVT - everything is already pre-configured to be flexible and as little as possible assumptions are made about the mission itself.

### So what's left until it's finished?
-
*	- [x] Loadouts are important
*		- [ ] Work a system for containers/vehicles, should be easy
*	- [x] Start working on the DAC plugin
*		- [ ] Make native functions and abstract settings into a separate file
*		- [ ] Parameters as well
*		- [ ] IMPORTANT: functions to create zones using only reference markers
*	- [ ] Work on the HC functionality.

### What then?

I am very commited to document and explain the usability process of this framework so that even the most clueless user can pick it up and get cracking in a few hours at most - expect a wiki with all the API and functions, and definitely video tutorials since I'm a video learner myself.
